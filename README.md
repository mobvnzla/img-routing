# img-routing

## how to export an img as a js object from a js file?

1. hint from a friend
   a friend is telling me that this trick works differently if we try it on vanilla or react

2. hit from another friend
   it's not configured to deal with local files. it's a problem about webpack. About the syntax to import, it is correct.
